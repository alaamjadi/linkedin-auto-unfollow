# LinkedIn Auto Unfollow

## 🚀 Overview

`linkedin-auto-unfollow` is a **JavaScript automation script** designed to **unfollow all connections** on the LinkedIn **Followers** page.  
The script automatically clicks **"Following"** buttons, confirms **"Unfollow"** actions, and **scrolls** to load more connections.

⚠️ **Caution:**

- Using automation on LinkedIn **may lead to account restrictions, temporary logouts, or even bans.**
- **A delay has been added** between actions to minimize the risk, but during testing, multiple logouts occurred.
- **Use at your own risk!**
